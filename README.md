### Hi there 👋

I'm Aren (he/him), a 20 year old software developer from the United Kingdom. I'm currently studying Computer Science
at the [University of Hull](https://hull.ac.uk). I'm looking to specialise in Security Engineering for 
Cloud technologies and architecture. 

I believe that security is an important part of not only our daily business life, but our social life as well. Together as a community, we can ensure that our data is protected by using:
- 🔐 Multi-factor authentication
- 📝 Stop using username and password authentication in favour of OAuth technologies
- 🔑 Use a single-sign on hardware key such as a [YubiKey](https://https://yubikey.me/)
- And so much more we have yet to properly discover.

The best way to contact me for business enquries is thrugh my email which is `me [at] arenmarsden.com`

### Technologies
I've been programming as a novice since I was around 13, and professionally since I was around 18. I got my 
first internship working in a WordPress house for a business-to-business charity, and before then, and still, I am a self-employed Linux System Administrator.

**I know**
- Java
- Kotlin
- C and C++
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud

I currently specialise in JVM-based languages such as Java and Kotlin, however, I am also currently learning Go, which has amazing concurrency built in for mission critical applications such as financial technoloy and cloud computing.
